Your best pal in hell

Don't be so miserable and desperate, pop up the Tristar and take care of your own business.

(generate ip addresses, trim out the ones starting with zero before or after splitting the huge generated file into a 200-300 MB slices of data, and load as many as you can into the Tristar, SSD VRAM is recommended on a system level and use Windows 11 lower system can crash running it) Install CUDA Toolkit or Rocm to use GPU acceleration.

Doesn't matter what you want don't leave fields empty, type in something everywhere.
